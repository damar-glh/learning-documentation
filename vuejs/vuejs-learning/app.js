    description: "Styled in metallic Eclipse Gray or pearlescent Moonlight White, the Zephyrus G14 is a stunner. Its clean aesthetic travels easily from LAN parties to lecture halls, with fine-tuned detailing that puts it in a class of its own. Precision CNC milling creates 6,536 perforations across the aluminum lid for a distinctive dot matrix design. Honeycomb reinforcements add strength with minimal material to keep the chassis light. The magnesium-aluminum alloy deck is fingerprint resistant to keep it looking fresh day to day.",
